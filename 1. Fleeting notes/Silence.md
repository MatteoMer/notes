# Silence
My definition of Silence doesn't imply sound
## First definition of the Silence:
The Silence is a moment where the external world is not talking to us. We are here are observers, and we actively have to choose what we want to observe; either us or the external world itself.
Silence is also only there in times you are not excepting anything special from the moment itself.
### Examples
- Taking a coffee by yourself in place, without phone or music.
- Working on something without notifications.
- Taking a shower
### Counter examples
- Walking with music
- Reading a book (you're excepting something special to happen)
### Unsure
- Sport by yourself ? It could enter the definition or not.

## Notes
I love going to Japan because Silence is present there everywhere, because even things that are made to take my attention doesn't affect me because I can't read or understand what's going on.

Is Sapiens biologically made for Silence?
