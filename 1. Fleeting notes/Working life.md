# Working life

More and more I feel disconnected with a part of the thinking about hard working that my family and friends have. I can clearly understand that most people will want to work "enough" to have a good living and after work doing things they like, watching movies, going out etc...

I call that "working to live your life" and it's probably what most people should aspire to

But on my side I feel that I want to have "work as my life", in the sense that I want to dedicate my life and my energy to my work, not in the sense of the company I work for, but that my work is so linked to my values that I want to work everyday to learn more, create more and live my life around it.

I feel like people don't really understand it and tell me to "go slower", "do some breaks", "do something else" but it's not how it works in my mind; everything I do on the day to day aspires to make my learning and creativity better, to me if I clean my place; it's for being in a better environment to work. 

I still of course do things not related to work, but I think I always watch things that are making me a better person to get my goals, even when I read Dune, I can take things from it. I've never enjoyed watching/reading things where I can't relate it to what I love the most to do.

I think I need to get out of this paradigm where most people find a kind of balance that they like, because I'm too intense to find a balance in this setting, my balance is probably not working 12h/day but it's closer to do that than timing my 9 to 5 at the exact minute so I can think of something else
