# Mathematical Proofs

Proofs are a way to convince someone that a statement is correct.

Traditionally, a mathematical proof is something that can be written and checked line-by-line to make sure it's correct. 
The traditional notion of proofs is captured by the complexity class **[[NP]]**

However we are now also interested in more exotic forms of proofs such [[Interactive Proof|interactive proofs]]
