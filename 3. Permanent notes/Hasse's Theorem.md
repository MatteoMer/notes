# Hasse's Theorem

The Hasse Theorem is used to get an approximation of how many points are on an EC defined over $F_P$. (see also [[Elliptic Curve over Finite Fields]])

Let $E$ an EC over $\mathbb{F_p}$. Then
$\#E(\mathbb{F_p})=p+1-t_p\text{ with }t_p\text{ satisfy }|t_p| \leq 2\sqrt p$.
$t_p$ is called the **trace of Frobenius** for $E/\mathbb{F_p}$. 

It means that the numbers of points over will be between $p+1-2\sqrt p$ and $p+1+2\sqrt p$.
