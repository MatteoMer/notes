# Stress about the future

## Agricultural Revolution
[[Agricultural Revolution]] created a new temporality to life of [[Homo Sapiens|Sapiens]].

Before that, Sapiens didn't thought much about the future, they were much more focused on surviving day to day.

Agriculture creates a tons of new stress in the day-to-day life of a sapiens: what if we don't have enough, what if there's some floods? etc etc

Also it's important to notice, that compared to their ancestors, they could actively predict and counter some futures issues (creating a new field etc)

**The fact that they could act on the future created a lot of new stress**. 
If you can't act on it, you can't really stress about it.
