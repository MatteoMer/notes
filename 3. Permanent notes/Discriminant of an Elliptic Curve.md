# Discriminant of an Elliptic Curve

The discriminant of an [[3. Permanent notes/Elliptic Curves|elliptic curve]] is $4A^3+27B^2$.

If the discriminant is 0, then the equation will repeated roots, which we don't want in the curve; that's why in the [[Elliptic Curve Definition|definition]] we ask $4A^3+27B^2\neq0$ 

We say that the curve is **non singular** when $det\neq0$, making the [[Elliptic Curve Addition|group law]] non ambiguous.
