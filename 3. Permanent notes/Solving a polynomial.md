# Solving a polynomial

[[Roots of a polynomial|Roots]] are interesting especially looking at the [[Prime factorization of a polynomial|prime factorization]], since we can show that for any root $x_0$ of $P$, the polynomial $f(x)=(x-x_0)$ is a prime factor of $P$.

Finding the roots of a polynomial is sometimes called *solving a polynomial*. It's consider a difficult problem to solve.
