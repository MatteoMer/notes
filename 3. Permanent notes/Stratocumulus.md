# Stratocumulus

Stratocumulus in another kind of [[cumulus]] cloud, if there is one cumulus cloud we'll say it's a cumulus, same goes for two of them, but if there's many of them almost or completely touching each other, we're going to say it's a stratocumulus cloud.
It's the most common cloud in the world, but we don't see it so often, because they are mostly above oceans.
