# Animal extinctions

[[Homo Sapiens|Sapiens]] always has been a big danger for the environment and especially animal species.
### Between [[Cognitive Revolution|cognitive]] and [[Agricultural Revolution|agricultural]] evolutions
While in the African-Asian continent, animals had time to see the threat coming, and evolve to fear humans, in the part where Sapiens colonized (Americas, Australia), it lead to the extinctions to a huge number of species, especially bigger animals (mammouths for example), since they were chased by humans for their big quantity of meat and fur.
