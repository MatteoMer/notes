# Cumulonimbus

Other type of [[cumulus]] that will be the only one with precipitations: actually **nimbus** means precipitations, so if we see rain or snow and a cumulus cloud, it's a cumulonimbus.
Cumulus clouds can be come cumulonimbus if the conditions are met. 
They can have a flat bottom sometimes, making them easy to recognize.

They have the [[Cumuloform clouds|cumuloform]] shape.

The top of a cumulonimbus is called the [[Anvil of a cumulonimbus|anvil]]
