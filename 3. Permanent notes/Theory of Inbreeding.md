# Theory of Inbreeding

The theory of inbreeding is a theory that says that [[Homo Sapiens]] had children with other [[Homo (genus)]] species and that's why Homo Sapiens is today the only descendant we have.

We know that there was some inbreeding at this time but it seems that it was very rare.

The other main theory is the [[Theory of Replacement]]
