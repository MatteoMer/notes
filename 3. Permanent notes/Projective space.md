# Projective space
The projective space is a geometrical space noted by $\mathbb{P}$.
In this space we work with the $n+1$ space.
We work with lines in this space.

## Link between [[Affine Space|affine]] and projective points
The points on the projective space are:
$$(x,y)\in\mathbb{A}^2 = (\lambda x,\lambda y,\lambda)\in \mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{F})\text{ where }\lambda\in\mathbb{F} $$
$\mathbb{P}^2=\mathbb{A}^3\setminus \{0,0,0\}$ modulo the fact that points will be in the space only "once" if they're equivalent to some $\lambda$: if $(x_1,y_1,z_1)=(\lambda x_2, \lambda y_2, \lambda z_2)$ then only the first will be in $\mathbb{P}^2$. (this is a congruence)

The [[congruence]] is noted $(X,Y,Z)$ and it represents all the point on the line in $\mathbb{P}^2$ that corresponds to $(x,y) \in \mathbb{A}^2$.
