# Proofs systems

A proof system is a procedure that decides if a [[Mathematical Proofs|proof]] is convincing (valid) or not for a given statement. 
Properties that we want in a proof system:
- **[[Completeness]]**
- **[[Soundness]]**
- Verification should be efficient, meaning that any proof can be **checked quickly** 
- Proving should be efficient as well, meaning that a convincing proof should be **easy to find**.
