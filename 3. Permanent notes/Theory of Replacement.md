# Theory of Replacement

The theory of replacement is that [[Homo Sapiens]] killed every other [[Homo (genus)]] species, and that's why Homo Sapiens is the only descendant we have today.

We don't know or why. It could have been the first genocide of [[Homo Sapiens]]?

Another plausible theory is [[Theory of Inbreeding]]
