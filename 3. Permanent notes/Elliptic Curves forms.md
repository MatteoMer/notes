# Elliptic Curves forms

The most common form in [[3. Permanent notes/Elliptic Curves|EC]] is the [[Short Weierstrass equation]] form, but in practice this form is almost not used (at least not in the [[Affine Space]]) because the computation is [[Speeding up EC computation|more expensive]]. 

There's other forms of EC but all of them are isomorphic to the SW form.
