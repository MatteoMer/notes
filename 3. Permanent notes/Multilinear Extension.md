# Multilinear Extension

A function $v$-variate function $f$ over the domain $\{0,1\}^v$ have a extension which is a [[multilinear polynomial]] (denoted $\tilde{f}$). 
It's similar to a [[Univariate Low Degree Extension|LDE]] but has a much lower [[Degree of polynomial|degree]]. (It has a degree $v$ at most).
