# Homo Sapiens cooking

## Between Cognitive and Agricultural
Cooking was an important thing for [[Homo Sapiens]] at this time. 

He stopped eating raw food that took hours and hours to eat and a lot of energy and instead could cook the meat, taking way less energy, and cooking also removed a lot of parasites from the food!

We believe that cooking helped Homo Sapiens getting more intelligent since he had more energy to give to his brain.
