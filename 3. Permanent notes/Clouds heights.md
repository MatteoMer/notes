# Clouds heights
We can 3 different heights for a cloud: low, middle and high.
The clouds are in the troposphere.
They can be close to the [[tropopause]], where we would describe them as high, close to earth, described as low or the in the middle, described as... the middle.

- If a cloud is a cloud is high we put cirro as a prefix
- If a cloud is in the middle we put alto as a prefix
- If a cloud is low, we don't put any prefix

Note: the higher a cloud is, the smaller it will look like for us (due to distance)
