# Evolution of Humanity

Humans always used technology to evolve into something new. 

For example before [[Homo Sapiens|Sapiens]] discovered fire they had to eat raw meat which used tons of energy, it wasn't the case after discovering [[Discovery of fire|fire]], which leads to [[Homo Sapiens cooking|cook]] the food, enabling Sapiens to use his energy to breed his brain instead! 

As another example we can think of the fact technology bring us cars, trains or even horses to move more quickly instead of walking.
