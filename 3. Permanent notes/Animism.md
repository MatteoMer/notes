# Animism

Animism is a belief in which you believe, that every place, every animal, every object, every [[Clouds classification|clouds]] (everything) has his own soul and can communicate directly to humans (and everything else).

Animism also belief in some local spirits (forest's spirit for example).

The beliefs are very **local** (there is no one powerful god that knows everything).

We believe that [[Homo Sapiens]] between [[Cognitive Revolution]] and [[Agricultural Revolution]] had some animism beliefs (at least some groups).
