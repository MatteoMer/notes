# Imaginary
Imaginary for [[Homo Sapiens|Sapiens]] is born thanks to the new [[Sapiens language|language]] after [[Cognitive Revolution|cognitive revolution]].

The fact that sapiens could talk about things that don't exist in his own world has lead to the creations of the first gods, the first beliefs and because of that, it permitted for two complete strangers to trust each other because they had the same "imaginary" beliefs. 

As of today, our entire world is based on that. 
Justice, countries, laws, companies, money, etc don't exist in nature and only exists because we all believe in it. ([[Imagined Orders]])
