# Arguments

Arguments are like [[Interactive Proof|IP]], but they enable the existence of proofs of "incorrect" statements, so long as these proofs require exorbitant computational power.

Arguments make use of cryptography, so a cheating prover would have to break a very difficult problem to cheat. (such as the [[Discrete Logarithm Problem]])
