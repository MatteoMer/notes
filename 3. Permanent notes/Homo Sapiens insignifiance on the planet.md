# Homo Sapiens insignifiance on the planet

[[Homo Sapiens]] for millions of years was part of nature like any other species, he was not more strong and looking at any other specie would have been looking very similar.

He was not at the top of the food chain, not hunting for big animals and was having food by going after big animals that attacked others. 

A big evolution that made Homo Sapiens way more strong is the [[Discovery of fire|discovery of fire]]
