# Agricultural Revolution

In [[Homo Sapiens]] history, the agricultural revolution is the second revolution after [[Cognitive Revolution|the cognitive one]]. It's when Sapiens decided to settle in one place and do agriculture instead of hunting-gathering to get food. The could grow, [[Homo Sapiens cooking|cook]], then eat some wheat (or rice, etc)! 

Agricultural Revolution most likely happened in multiple places of the world at different times, the oldest one we know being near south-east Turkey, where can see the first traces of agriculture.

It lead to a massive population growth, but in the other hand, it also led to a less diverse life.
