# Setup a garbled circuit scheme

The first step of [[Garbled Circuits]] 
For every gate of our [[Garbled Circuits|circuit]] (that have either 0 or 1 as output), we create two labels (256bits-numbers): one that represents 0 and another that represents 1.
We do this for every intermediate wires but not the outputs ones.
