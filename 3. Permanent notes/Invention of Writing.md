# Invention of Writing

New issues developed with the arrival of [[imagined orders]], the memory of the humans brains was not enough anymore, there was much more information to remember, in format that didn't fitted the human brain.

The solution [[Homo Sapiens|Sapiens]] found was writing. 
At first writing was a [[Partial Writing System|partial writing system]] used for accountability reasons (how much food was produced by this person this year for example).
For that reason, it's obvious that numbers were invented at the same time as other kinds of writing.

Another challenge coming at the same time as the invention of writing is classifying writings.
It's as hard to invent a language that invent an efficient document classification. (If you cannot find an archive, why writing it?)
