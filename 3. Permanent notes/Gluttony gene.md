# Gluttony gene

It's likely that we developed and we have a today a gluttony gene, that makes us eat even when we're already full. 

This gene could have been developed between [[Cognitive Revolution]] and [[Agricultural Revolution]], because when a [[Homo Sapiens|Sapiens]] discovered some food (for example a tree full of fruits), he could only eat as much as he could, before other animals would discover it as well and steal everything!
