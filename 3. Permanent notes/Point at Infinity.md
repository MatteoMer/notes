# Point at Infinity

The point at infinity in an [[3. Permanent notes/Elliptic Curves|elliptic curve]] is a point that does not exists in the XY-plane, but we will pretends this point is at the "end" of each vertical line in $E$.

Because of that we will get some nice properties that will be very useful in [[Elliptic Curve Addition]]

For example, with $P, Q \in E$:
- $P+P'=\mathcal{O}$ 
- $Q+P+\mathcal{O}=Q+P$ 
- $P+\mathcal{O}= P$ 

### Note
It's possible to represent [[Point at infinity in the projective space|the point at infinity in the projective space]]
