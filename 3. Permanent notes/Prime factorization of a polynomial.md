# Prime factorization of a polynomial

[[Irreducible polynomials]] are what [[prime numbers]] are to integers, building block from which every polynomial are constructed.
Let $P\in R[x]$ there's always some irreducible polynomials $F_1, F_2, ..., F_n\in R[x]$ s.t:$$F_1\cdot F_2\cdot...\cdot F_n=P$$
It's called the prime factorization of $P$.
