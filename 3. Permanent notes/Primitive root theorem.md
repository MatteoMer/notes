# Primitive root theorem

The primitive root theorem tells us that there's a $g$ whose powers gives any element of $\mathbb{F}_p^*$.
These elements element ($g$ for example) have an order of $p-1$.

$g$ is called a **primitive root**, this is the number whose powers generate a group $G$ where the elements are all the elements of $\mathbb{F}_p^*$ in some order.
$$\mathbb{F}_p^*=*\{1,g,g^1,g^2,g^3,...,g^{p-2}\}\pmod p$$
Note that $g^{p-1}=1$ by [[Little Fermat's Theorem]].
