# Mersenne Prime

A Mersenne prime is a prime in the form $2^p-1$ where $p$ is a prime.
For example $2^2-1=3,2^3-1=7{...}$ 
#### Warning
Not all $2^p-1$ numbers are prime. $2^{11}-1=2047=23\cdot 89$

## Note
Mersenne prime are one way to generate large primes numbers. I think we can check if the number is prime using [[3. Permanent notes/Miller-Rabin Test|Miller-Rabin Test]]
