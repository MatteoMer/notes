# Luxury will become a necessity

In life, when [[Homo Sapiens|we]] achieve some kind of luxury (better food, more money, etc); we have the tendency to take it as granted very fast (especially if we talk at generation-level, but not only).

This leads to a more stressing life, because from what was a luxury, become a source of stress, to make sure we will get it.
