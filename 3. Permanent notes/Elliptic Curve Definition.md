# Elliptic Curve Definition
An elliptic curve is the set of solutions of the [[Short Weierstrass equation|short weirstrass equation]] together with a point $\mathcal{O}$ where $A$ and $B$ must satisfy $4A^3+27B^2\neq0$. (see [[Discriminant of an Elliptic Curve]])

The set of the points of an elliptic curve forms an abelian group
## Point of infinity
The point $\mathcal{O}$ is called **point of infinity** and is very important in EC. See [[Point at Infinity]]
## Addition
It's possible to do addition of points that belongs to the same EC. See [[Elliptic Curve Addition]].
## Multiplication
It's also possible to do multiplication of point in an EC and an integer. See [[Scalar Multiplication in EC]].
