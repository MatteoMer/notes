# Interactive Proof

An interactive proof is a proof where an untrusted prover is trying to convince a verifier that his proof is valid for a certain statement.

The difference between [[Mathematical Proofs|more traditional proofs]] is that the verifier is able to ask the prover some random "challenges" about his proofs that must hold if the proof is valid.

The prover does not know the challenges before submitting his proofs.

As an analogy, we could think of a mathematician trying to convince another one, the latter asking questions and challenging him!
