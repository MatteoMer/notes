# Computation-powered humanity

The logical [[Evolution of Humanity|evolution of humanity]] is to let computers do part of your duties as an human ([[Homo Sapiens]]).

Computers can help with:
- long-term memory, with PKM
- short-term memory, with todo-list
- more ?

AI will make this even more powerful, and people not taking advantage of it will be left very far behind (it's already the case)
