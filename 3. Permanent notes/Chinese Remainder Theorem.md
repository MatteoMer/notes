# Chinese Remainder Theorem

The Chinese Remainder Theorem helps to solve a [[System of congruences|system of congruences]].
## Usage
This theorem is widely used in cryptography, as it allows to compute large integers by replacing one costly computation by multiple ones with smaller integers (so less costly).
## Theorem
Let $m_1, m_2, ..., m_k$ to be integers that are relatively prime to each other.
Let $a_1, a_2, ..., a_k$ to be arbitrary integers.
Then the solution of simultaneous congruence has a solution $x$ such that $x=c$. 
Further, if $x=c\space and\space x=c'$ then $c \equiv c' \pmod {m_1\cdot m_2\cdot\space ...\space \cdot m_k}$
