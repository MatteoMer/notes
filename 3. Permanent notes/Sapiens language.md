# Sapiens language

Before the [[cognitive revolution]], [[Homo Sapiens|Sapiens]] had a language similar to every other animals. He could talk about dangers that were coming soon, like "lion is coming, be careful!". 

His new language made possible that a limited number of sounds could make an infinite number of different sentences, giving different informations.

After the cognitive revolution, Sapiens had new abilities: 
- Ability to transmit a large number of informations about his own environment (way larger than before)
-  Ability to transmit a large number of informations about relationships between different Sapiens ([[Gossiping for Sapiens|gossiping]])
-  Ability to transmit a large number of informations about [[Imaginary|imaginary things]]
