# Imagined Orders

To create bigger communities, [[Homo Sapiens|Sapiens]] after [[Agricultural Revolution]] created what Hararri calls "Imagined Orders". 

These orders are shared with most the community (intersubjective), some more powerful than others. 
The goal of the orders is to create a stability in a community. 
If everyone follows it, it's supposed to be stable for the community.

Some example of imagined orders could be a company or the humans rights declaration for example. 
They don't exist biologically, but they are to create a "normal" order for people to follow.

Most of the times these orders are said to come from something bigger than humans themselves (god or nature) but in the end they are not.
