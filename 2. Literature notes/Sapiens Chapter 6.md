# Sapiens Chapter 6

Agricultural Revolution created a new temporality to life of Sapiens.

Before that, Sapiens didn't thought much about the future, they were much more focused on surviving day to day.

Agriculture creates a tons of new stress in the day-to-day life of a sapiens: what if we don't have enough, what if there's some floods? etc etc
Also it's important to notice, that compared to their ancestors, they could actively predict and counter some futures issues (creating a new field etc)

**The fact that they could act on the future created a lot of new stress**. 
If you can't act on it, you can't really stress about it.
## Imagined Orders
To create bigger communities, Sapiens created what Hararri calls "Imagined Orders".

These orders are shared with most the community (intersubjective), some more powerful than others. The goal of the orders is to create a stability in a community. If everyone follows it, it's supposed to be stable for the community.

Some example of imagined orders could be a company or the humans rights declaration for example. They don't exist biologically, but they are to create a "normal" order for people to follow.

Most of the times these orders are said to come from something bigger than humans themselves (god or nature) but in the end they are not.
