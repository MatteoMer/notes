## Classify a cloud
We need two things to classify a cloud: his **shape** and his **height**

We have 3 different shapes:
- Cumuloform 
- Stratoform
- Cirroform
And 3 different heights:
- Low
- Middle
- High
We can form the 10 possible name for the clouds with these parameters
## Shapes of the clouds
### Cumuloform clouds
The cumulus clouds look likes cotton or cauliflower etc, they are easy to distinguish, they always have puffy edges

### Stratoform clouds
They look like a blanket that covers the entire sky, not a lot of features, but we can't see the edges.

### Cirroform clouds
Lot of varieties but also very distinguishable because very thin, they can be straight, curly etc...

## Atmosphere structure
We can easily see that the higher we go up into the atmosphere, the colder it gets (for example on top of a mountain). 
This is true but until a certain point called the **tropopause**. Starting from this point, the temperature starts to go up again! 
This point forms the natural boundary between the **stratosphere** (above the point) and **troposphere** (below the point).

The average height of the tropopause is 36 000 feets, 11km, but it depends on a lot of factors (where on earth etc)

## Heights of the clouds
The clouds are in the troposphere.
They can be close to the tropopause, where we would describe them as high, close to earth, described as low or the in the middle, described as... the middle.

- If a cloud is a cloud is high we put cirro as a prefix
- If a cloud is in the middle we put alto as a prefix
- If a cloud is low, we don't put any prefix

Note: the higher a cloud is, the smaller it will look like for us (due to distance)

## Identify clouds
### Cumulus
The most common type of clouds, that we see in summer for example, the form will change. Also the proportions of the cloud will depend on the time we're looking at it, it can grow, diminish and then die.

### Altocumulus
It will appear smaller than a cumulus cloud because we're far, but also because they're actually smaller. 
![[Pasted image 20231127103154.png]]
### Cirrocumulus 
They are tiny, and will look very small, because they're far and also small in size. We can see through, light will go through it.

#### How to make the difference between altocumulus and cirrocumulus?
- If you see super tiny dots: cirrocumulus
- If they're on a similar size: if they have more shading (looking more 3D): altocumulus, if they look more 2D: cirrocumulus
### Cumulonimbus
Other type of cumulus that will be the only one with precipitations: actually cumulo**nimbus** means precipitations, so if we see rain or snow and a cumulus cloud, it's a cumulonimbus.
Cumulus clouds can be come cumulonimbus if the conditions are met. 

The top of a cumulonimbus is called the **anvil** and is made of ice.
It's not difficult to difference if a cloud is made of ice or liquid: if it's made of ice it look more fuzzy while with liquid it look more puffy and the edges will be very sharp and distinct.
If we can see the anvil, it's pretty much sure it's either raining or snowing under this cloud!

### Stratocumulus 
Stratocumulus in another kind of cumulus cloud, if there is one cumulus cloud we'll say it's a cumulus, same goes for two of them, but if there's many of them almost or completely touching each other, we're going to say it's a stratocumulus cloud.
It's the most common cloud in the world, but we don't see it so often, because they are mostly above oceans.

### Stratus
If the sky is grey and you cannot tell where the sun is, it's a stratus.
![[Pasted image 20231127103753.png]]
### Nimbostratus
If the sky is a stratus and there's some precipitation, it's a **nimbo**stratus.
With a cumulonimbus you can tell where the precipitation ends, not with the nimbostratus.

### Altostratus
Similar to stratus, but you can tell where the sun is (a bit blurred) (because the cloud is higher)
![[Pasted image 20231127104028.png]]
### Cirrostratus
This stratus is so high in the sky that it's only composed of ice, so when light goes through it, it creates an optical pattern: a circle around the sun (or the moon)

### Cirrus
Always on top, never low or middle, entirely made of ice, very thin can be seen as hairy, cobweb etc...

## Clouds that don't find the classification system
### Lenticular
Disks that forms on top of mountains, because on how to air flows, they also hover on top of the mountain without touching it. 
![[Capture d’écran 2023-11-26 à 17.59.49.png]]
They can also be in chain, because they're riding an air wave (because the air bouce, see schema)

![[Pasted image 20231127104850.png]]
### Mammatus 
These clouds are just under cumulonimbus, dripping under it. They are sinking cold air.
They are here just before or after a thunderstorm.
![[Pasted image 20231127105022.png]]
They can also form under the anvil.
