#### Error correction codes 
An error correction code transform a set string of which might be very similar ton one another to a set of string that are very different, meaning that it's much easier to detect when a string is wrong
##### Polynomials in error corrections codes
We can use polynomials instead of string in error correction codes, since two polynomials that seems similar on a domain will be very different in a much larger domain.
Such codes are named **Reed Solomon Codes**
#### Know if a subgroup exists in a prime field
If we want to know if $G$ a subgroup of order $n$ exist in $\mathbb{F}{^*_p}$, we can check if $n|(p-1)$. If so, the subgroup exists
#### Find generator of a subgroup
The generator of a subgroup will have the order of the subgroup.
When $k$ divides |$\mathbb{F}^**$|, $g^k$ generates a group of size $\frac{|\mathbb{F}^*|}{k}$. With $g$ being a generator of $\mathbb{F}$.
#### Roots of a polynomial
Roots of polynomial has the property that if $a$ is a root of $f$ s.t $f(a)=0$. Then there's a polynomial $g$ st $f(x)=(x-a)\cdot g(x)$ and $deg(f)=deg(q+1)$.
We can compute $q(x)$ by doing $\frac{f(x)}{(x-a)}$.
This fact is true for all $k$ roots of $f$, if $a_i$ is a root of $f$: $\forall \space i=0,...,k-1$, then there's a $q(x)$ with $deg(q)=deg(f)-k$ and equal to $\frac{f(x)}{\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}\cdot(x-a_i)}$.
## Proof system
An interactive proof is a system that has a _prover_ that wants to prove the integrity of a computation to a _verifier_.
The verifier goal is to be suspicious and distinguish the truth from the lies.
Prover and verifiers communicates via messages to one another and at the end of the process, the verifier outputs a decision wether it believes the prover or not.
## STARK
STARKs is a type of SNARKs using the proof system FRI, the name stands for **STARK: Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge**.
### Scalability in STARK 
- Scalable prover: prove in nearly linear time, close to what a trusted party would need to re-run the tx
- Scalable verifier: run in log(naive replay time)
### Transparency
It means that STARKs don't need a trusted setup. 

## How to build a STARK?
### First step: Arithmetization
Also called reduction, arithmetization is the first of how we build a STARK, the goal is to transform a computation to the problem of verifying that a polynomial is of low degree.
It uses Error Correction Codes to test the low-degree-ness, and the verifier is convinced that the polynomial is low degree only if the computation is valid.

#### First step of arithmetization: generation of an execution trace.
The execution trace is a table with each step of the computation inside. It must be succintely testable, meaning it can be verified that a row is correct only by looking at the rows next to it. (we don't need to compute the whole execution again to verify one row). Each row as this succintness constraint.
#### Second step of arithmetization: polynomial constraints
The goal of polynomials constrainsts in STARK is to convert the execution trace into few polynomials that will constraint the input to follow a set of rules (so the trace is valid, and is doing what it should)

STARKs are using AIR
### Second step of STARKs
The goal of STARKs is that a verifier can decide in just a few questions whether to accept or reject the proof.
Ideally to do so, the verifier would ask for random values in the execution trace and look if constraints holds. The problem would be that it's very easy for an attacker to give wrong values to the verifier.

To address this problem we can use error correction codes by thinking of the execution trace as a polynomial, and evaluate it in a much larger domain. (we will use lagrange interpolation to find the polynomial)

Our plan is then:
1. Rephrase the execution trace as a polynomial
2. Extend it to a much larger domain
3. Transform it into another polynomial that respects the polynomial constrainst, this polynomial will be of low degree if valid.

### Succinctness
We want a very efficient verification technic for STARKs, that has two properties:
- A small number of queries (handled by error correction code)
- Small computation on each queries

A verifier could act like this:
- Querying the composition polynomial in random places
- Checking the low degreeness based on these queries

But an attacker could cheat a verifier by sending low degree values on some places while some others values aren't.

To prevent this, the verifier will ask for multiple values of $f(w)$ and build the composition polynomial himself.

For example if the composition polynomial is $f(g^2x)-f(gx)-f(x)$ the verifier would ask for these 3 values.

The verifier can then compute $\frac{f(g^2x)-f(gw)-f(w)}{\prod_{0}^{509}(w - g^i)}$. The denominator is easy to compute it independently, but this operation, for every row, will be very expensive.

But we can use an useful trick where if the power of $g$ forms a subgroup, we can notice that $x^{|G|} - 1=\prod_{g\in G}(x -g)$.
We can see that calculating the right side of the equation will take a linear number of equation, but for the left part, using the *square and multiply* algorithm it can be in done in logarithm time.

It's essential that the repeated pattern of the constrainst coincide with some subgroup of the field, so we can use this trick.
