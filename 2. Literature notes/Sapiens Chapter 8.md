# Sapiens Chapter 8

Hierarchies have always played a big part inside imagined orders, but societies have different ways of creating this hierarchies: racial, wealth or other

Most of the time hierarchies are the fruit of a random historical event that turned into a vicious circle, for example poors are always becoming poorer.

Also after this random event, dominants are almost always finding justification for their dominance, either from god or natural order of nature for example.

The most universal hierarchy is the patriarchy, in almost every society, a dominance from males is present, but there's no (as far as we know) any biological reasons for this dominance; also it's important to note that attribute that are known as masculine are highly dependent on the time and the place, some very masculine attribute in one society could be seen as feminine in another one.
