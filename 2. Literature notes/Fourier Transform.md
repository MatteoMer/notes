# Fourier Transform

Fourier transform is a transform that takes an input and gives all the different frequencies of this input. It can be written as 
$$
\mathcal{F}\{f(t)\} = F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i \omega t} dt 
$$
### Example
With an audio signal, different frequencies are mixed (added) to create a sound. With the Fourier transform you can get all the different frequencies that have been used to create the sound
