# Chapter 2 Sapiens

## Cognitive Revolution
Sapiens had a cognitive revolution around 70 000 years ago. His brain evolved in some way and something very important appeared: a new kind of language
### Language
Before the cognitive revolution, Sapiens had a language similar to every other animals. He could talk about dangers that were coming soon, like "lion is coming, be careful!". 
His new language made possible that a limited number of sounds could make an infinite number of different sentences, giving different informations

After the cognitive revolution, Sapiens had new abilities: 
- Ability to transmit a large number of informations about his own environment (way larger than before)
-  Ability to transmit a large number of informations about relationships between different Sapiens (gossiping)
-  Ability to transmit a large number of informations about imaginary things
### Gossiping
Gossiping lead to creating of way bigger communities, because gossiping is the base of solid relationships between Sapiens. Sapiens is a social animal, and gossiping is the normal way of making bounds
### Social imaginary
The fact that sapiens could talk about things that don't exist in his own world has lead to the creations of the first gods, the first beliefs and because of that, it permitted for two complete strangers to trust each other because they had the same "imaginary" beliefs. As of today, our entire world is based on that. Justice, countries, laws, companies, money, etc don't exist in nature and only exists because we all believe in it.
