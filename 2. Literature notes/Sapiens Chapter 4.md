# Chapter 4 Sapiens

## Travel
After the cognitive revolution, Sapiens became a much better traveler.

He started to travel across seas, notably the sea between Indonesia and Australia.
We can also note that thanks to his new abilities, he got to Alaska, making it possible for Sapiens to colonize Americas.
## Animal extinctions
Sapiens was a big danger for the environment and especially animal species.
### Between cognitive and agricultural evolutions
While in the African-Asian continent, animals had time to see the threat coming, and evolve to fear humans, in the part where Sapiens colonized (Americas, Australia), it lead to the extinctions to a huge number of species, especially bigger animals (mammouths for example), since they were chased by humans for their big quantity of meat and fur.
## Personal note
It seems that humans were naturally tied to migrate and travel, humans seems to always want to discover more things and fill their curiosity
