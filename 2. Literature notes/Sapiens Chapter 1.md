# Chapter 1 Sapiens

Homo is a family that emerged from Australopithecus, and Homo Sapiens is our direct descendant.

But Homo Sapiens was not alone and had many brother and sisters back in time, we are still discovering some today.

In nature, Homo Sapiens wasn't always on the top of the food chain. He was surviving like any weak animal in the nature for millions of years! 

The discovery of fire helped Homo Sapiens to be more dominant and also helped them becoming more intelligent, mostly because of cooking. 

They had less time to spent eating raw food, they could cook instead, letting more energy everyday to develop his brain.

Today, Homo Sapiens is the only descendant we have, and there's two different theories about why it happened:
- Theory of replacement
- Theory of interbreeding
As of today know that there was some interbreeding but it wasn't very common.
