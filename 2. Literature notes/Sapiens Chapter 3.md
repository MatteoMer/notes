# Chapter 3 Sapiens

Sapiens between the cognitive and agricultural revolution are very much unknown.
They were nomads and didn't had much belongings, making it difficult for us to trace how they lived.
It's very likely that every group of Sapiens had very different beliefs and habits. 
For example, it's likely that some of their groups had some animism beliefs.

Sapiens during this time had a very diverse nutrition regime, since they were nomads, they were everyday looking for something to eat (meat, plants, insects, ...).
This alimentation and their way of life made them very healthy!
### Gluttony gene
It's likely that we developed and we have a today a gluttony gene, that makes us eat even when we're already full. 

This gene could have been developed at this period, because when a Sapiens discovered some food (for example a tree full of fruits), he could only eat as much as he could, before other animals would discover it as well and steal everything! 
### Animism
Animism is a belief in which you believe, that every place, every animal, every object (everything) has his own soul and can communicate directly to humans (and everything else).
Animism also belief in some local spirits (forest's spirit for example).
The beliefs are very local (there is no one powerful god that knows everything).
