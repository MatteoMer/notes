# Sapiens Chapter 5

## Agricultural Revolution
Agricultural Revolution most likely happened in multiple places of the world at different times, the oldest one we know being near south-east Turkey, where can see the first traces of agriculture.
### Wheat
Agricultural revolution is highly linked to wheat, during this time, climate was making it easy for wheat to grow, and when Sapiens were processing wheat to make some food, it also helped the wheat to have some more seeds dispersed in new places.
So each year, more wheat was there at the same place, making Sapiens more likely to stay at the same place longer and longer until completely settling there.
### Sapiens growth
The most important revolution that agricultural revolution has is that it came with an exponential growth of humans. Woman had more children, and agricultural made it easier to feed them. 
### A less diverse life
Agricultural revolution led Sapiens to have a less diverse life than before. From now on, instead of looking for different sources of food everyday, they would spend their time doing the same repetitive tasks, that they were not built for.
### Luxury becoming a necessity
While at first, it seemed that wheat was a blessing because it meant a less dangerous day-to-day life for Sapiens (they didn't needed to attack dangerous species anymore for example), this blessing, we can see as a luxury for the time, became a necessity very quickly.
With the growing number of children, they had to produce more and more wheat to continue to feed the entire population.
