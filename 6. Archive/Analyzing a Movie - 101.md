# Analyzing a Movie - 101

Analyzing art comes down to two steps:
- Look closely at the piece and describe it, what the piece is, what's happening
- Asking why? every part of the piece is a choice, what's the goal, how does it make me feel?

Analysis does not stops at what the artist meant. Art is subjective.

First step to analyze a movie: look at the movie a macro level: what are the conflicts, how are they resolved, how do the characters changes? We can extract the themes from that and try to get what the movie is trying to say.

Let's focused on what the story we got from there to see how it's told in the movie?
### Visual Language/Mise en scÃ¨ne
The movie gives us clues on how to watch it, especially in the earliest scenes about the tons and visual language of the movie.

We can assume that filmmakers are making choices, and we can give them credit for that, and then ask why? We don't have to like the choices (of course).
#### Style and aesthetic
It's great to know where to place the movie between Realism and Formalism

**Realism**: Pure reflection of reality; ex: workers getting out of the factory
**Formalism**: Complete surrealism that doesn't try to reflect reality at all

In the middle there's **Classicism** that uses realistic elements (real actors, locations, subtle editing) but uses some formalism for some camera angle and movements, musics. Sometime these elements will be used to make the viewer understand how a character feels
#### Objective or Subjective?
**Objective**: The film is a neutral observer of what's happening in the movie with no involvement of the story
**Subjective**: The film shows us of a character is seeing what's happening in his point of view
It can change scene to scene
#### Lenses
Every lens has a focal length:
Lower number -> wider lens
Higher number -> longer lens

Choice of lens can completely change how a shot looks like
Longer lens -> narrower field of view and compress image, background looks closer to the foreground. Also it has a big depth of field, meaning if focus is on foreground, everything in the background will be blurry. Used in close-up

Wider lens -> Much wider field of view, more environement in the frame, out of focus aren't as a blurry as longer. Also for very wide lens, there's some warp (gopro) around the frame. The world is exagereted in wider lens. 

Lenses are used to demonstrate different things, longer lenses can isolate the character from the background making him lonely for example while wider ones can make someone looks bigger/crazier than he his    
#### Colors
Can affect interpretation/meaning with the color of sets/costumes/post prod etc. There's no one meaning for each colors.
But in general, warm colors are attracting and reassuring in general, we associate it with sunsets, fireplaces etc
While colders colors make the oppposite
#### Aspect Ratio
Ratio of width/height. At first in movies, it was pretty much a squared, then it evolved into different aspect ratios since wider aspect ratio were available.
The aspect ratio is important because it changes fundamentally how shots are framed.
#### Lighting
Super important, gives it mood and atmosphere. Tells us where to look. Most of the time we're not supposed to notice the lighting. 
#### Camera movement
**Blocking**: How actors and objects moves within the frame
**Pan**: When camera moves on the X axis left or right
**Tilting**: When the camera moves on the Y axis up or down
**Zoom**: Done within the lens, but the camera doesn't move. The focal length is increasing or decreasing
**Tracking shot**: Camera moves through spaces (gimball/dolly/steadycam)
**Crane shot**: Camera moves vertically
**Helicopter/Drone**: extension of crane shot
**Handheld shot**: Camera is hold by hand
**Cowboy shot**: Shot that frames the character from top to the hips to make him heroic
#### Editing
In most movies -> continuity editing -> chronologically logical
Editing helps the movie to tell the story and visual language.
For example Parasite is slow and tense until the end very the editing is chaotic (i think)
#### Sound
Sound is like editing most of the time, it will be unnoticed most of the time. But sometimes it's interesting the see that sound can be used to show contrast between two POV (an empty house/an airplane) with just a cut in the edit, but the sound shows really the difference
##### Music
Can do a lot: create subtext, mood of a scene, comment ironically a scene, ...

Now that we can interpret the movie, what do we do?
### Chose a lens to interpret the movie
What context we want to look at the film in?
A few:
#### Auteur theory
Started with Truffaut and Bazin.
The idea of this theory is that the movie can be assigned to a primary author to a film, generally the director, and looking at the film with the context of their body of work.
Each director have their own views of the world and personality, and two directors with the same script will do opposite things.

**The author does not have to be the director**, for example, the main author of Mission Impossible can be told as Tom Cruise. MCU is Marvel etc.
And also to multiple people! Producer, Director, Writer etc
#### Cinema History
Every movies can be seen in the timeline between movies before them, contemporary to them, after them... Every movie has been influenced buy some things
#### Genre
Genre is mostly about audience expectations, since audience expect some things from a genre.
