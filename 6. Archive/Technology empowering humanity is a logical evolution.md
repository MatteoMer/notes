# Technology empowering humanity is a logical evolution

Humans always used technology to evolve into something new. 

For example before Sapiens discovered fire they had to eat raw meat which used tons of energy, it wasn't the case after discovering fire, which leads to cook the food, enabling Sapiens to use his energy to breed his brain instead! (Or cars/trains/horses vs walking).

We can make a parallel with computers, that is enabling humans to delegate some tasks he had to do by himself (short and long term memory for example) to a computer. 

I don't know where this will lead but I think it's the normal way of evolution
