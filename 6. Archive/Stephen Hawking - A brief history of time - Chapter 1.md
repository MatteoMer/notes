# Stephen Hawking - A brief history of time - Chapter 1

This chapter gives some historical data and reasons about our actual scientific knowledge; SH introduces the multiple advancements we made in the understanding of earth, the universe and time.
- Aristotle wrote in one of his book that the earth is a round sphere because:
	- In a lunar eclipse, if the earth was flat, most of the time it should not cover the entire moon
	- Depending on how north or south you are on earth, the north star is at a different place (on the north pole it would be on top of you, while at the horizon at the equator)
	- When you see a ship from far away, you see first the head and then the rest

- In these times, they thought that earth was the center of the universe, the universe was finite and not moving. Ptolemy made a prediction model based on these beliefs, but it was flawed (even him recognized it); but the Christian Church used this model because it was possible to have heaven and hell somewhere further the stars we can see (stars were the end of the universe, based on the model)
- Copernicus was the first one to think that the earth was moving around the sun. He made a model where the earth was making perfect circles around the sun
- Galileo and Kepler got interested by this model around 100y after, but the prediction were not very good
- Kepler discovered that the model was working with an ellipse instead of a circle, but no idea why
- Newton with his theory on how bodies moves around space in time, with mass attracting each other, made easier to validate a model on how the earth, moon etc were moving around the sun
- He could not understand why stars were not falling through each other (if they're attracted), so he had the idea that the universe is infinite, and because of that the masses had no "center" were they could fall. He also had a theory where very distant forces would repulse instead of attracting
- Interestingly, lots of his pairs showed the flaws about the model, that for example if universe was infinite, then it wouldn't be possible to have a dark sky, because at some point we would encounter a star.
- The only good reason would be that the stars lights on at some point in time, and some of them didn't reached us yet (the light).
- They're some interesting debates around the creation of the universe, was it always here, was it created, when? etc
- In 1929, Hubble made the observation that galaxies were more and more distant from us, meaning that the universe is expanding.
- From that he created the concept of big bang, the point of start of the universe, and also the creation of time, because everything before couldn't influence what happened after
End of the chapter is about what is a scientific theory (simple facts that can predict the future, each time it's good, the belief is strong, but can be invalidated).
The two big scientific theories are: the general relativity and the quantum theory. One is for the infinitely big, the other about the infinitely small.
Both theory cannot be true at the same time, but some work is done to creates one that is holding both.
Two big questions: Can we have a theory that predict everything in the universe, some kind of general theory? Can we understand with which laws the universe have been created?

## Key points
1. Our understanding of the universe has evolved slowly but surely
2. The understanding of the universe is deeply linked about what time is
3. As humanity, understanding the universe we live in is a profound goal since the beginning of our times and will probably never stops 
4. Works nowadays is about finding a general theory between quantum and general relativity
