# Matteo's research notes

This is where you can find all notes I've taken in different topics!
For now it's mostly maths/cryptography but it will hopefully evolve with time.

ps: references section on my notes are broken here, because it's useful for me on my local version, but I don't think it is here!
### Disclaimer
These pages are a collection of my thoughts and learnings across various topics, so keep in mind that they might not be 100% accurate or complete! (especially for maths lol)
